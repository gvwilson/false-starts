# Software Engineering: A Compassionate Approach

This book will help you succeed in your first large software development project.
Some parts focus on tools like version control and testing frameworks;
others on working practices like running productive meetings,
deciding who is responsible for what,
and cutting features when time runs short.

*SECA* differs from other introductions to software engineering in three ways:

1.  Our aim is to teach you how to be a *compassionate programmer*:
    one who cares as much about the well-being of their colleagues and users
    as they do about their own.
    This focus is not entirely altruistic—everything you do to help others
    also helps your future self—but now that we know how much harm software can do,
    we need to learn to build it in better ways.

2.  Wherever possible, we base our recommendations on empirical studies
    of software and the people who build it.
    To help you understand and evaluate these studies,
    we use problems in data analytics for our examples.
