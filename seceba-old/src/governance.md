This project uses [Martha's Rules][marthas-rules] or consensus decision making:

1.  Before each meeting, anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal.  Proposals
    must be filed at least 24 hours before a meeting in order to be considered,
    and must include:
    -   a one-line summary
    -   the full text of the proposal
    -   any required background information
    -   pros and cons
    -   possible alternatives

2.  A quorum is established in a meeting if half or more of voting members are
    present.

3.  Once a person has sponsored a proposal, the group may not discuss or vote on
    the issue unless the sponsor or their delegate is present.

4.  After the sponsor presents the proposal a sense vote is cast:
    -   Thumbs up: who likes the proposal?
    -   Thumbs down: who is uncomfortable with the proposal?
    -   Thumbs sideways: who can live with?

5.  If everyone likes or can live with the proposal, it passes with no further
    discussion.

6.  If the majority is uncomfortable with the proposal, it is sent back to its
    sponsor for further work.  (The sponsor may decide to drop it if it's clear
    the majority isn't ever going to support it.)

7.  Otherwise, the group has a brief moderated discussion.  After 10 minutes, or
    when no one has anything further to add, the moderator calls for a straight
    yes-or-no vote on the proposal.  If a majority votes "yes" it is adopted;
    otherwise, it is returned to the sponsor for further work.
