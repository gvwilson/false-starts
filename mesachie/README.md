This book will help you succeed in your first team software project.
Some of the tools we describe are technical,
like version control and testing frameworks;
others will help you form teams,
manage people who aren't pulling their weight,
cut features when time runs short,
and understand who should get credit for what you build.

Our aim is to teach you how to be a *compassionate programmer*:
one who cares about the well-being of their colleagues and users.
This focus is not entirely altruistic—everything you do to help others
also helps your future self—but
now that we all know how much harm software can do,
we hope you'll be interested in some practical idealism.
