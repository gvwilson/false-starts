title: Research Software by Example
---

The best way to learn design in any field is to study examples,
so the Caycuse Problems are a set of medium-sized programs
chosen to help you learn how to design better research software.
These lessons build small versions of things ranging from
a simulation of cinder formation
to a tool for scraping package release data from the web,
both to demystify them
and to give some insights into how experienced programmers think.
