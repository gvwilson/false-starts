          <p>This textbook for an introductory undergraduate course on software engineering
differs from others in four ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It teaches you to be a <em>compassionate programmer</em>:
    one who cares about the well-being of their colleagues and users
    as much as their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It draws on <em>empirical studies</em> whenever possible.
    To help you understand those studies,
    its motivating examples are data analysis problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It describes the <em>processes</em> professional programmers use
    and what students should aim for
    when they are juggling several courses at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It introduces specific <em>tools</em> that support those processes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each chapter is designed to fill two lecture hours,
including time for discussion.
All the material can be re-used and remixed under open licenses.
Fixes and additions are very welcome;
please note that all contributors must abide by our Code of Conduct.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-example">Section 1.1: An Example</h2>
<p>Are some programmers really ten times more productive than average?
To find out,
<span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bibliography/#Prechelt2000">Prechelt2000</a>]</span> had a set of programmers solve the same problem in the language of their choice,
then looked at how long it took them,
how good their solutions were,
and how fast those solutions ran.
The data,
which is <a href="http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/prechelt/packages/jccpprtTR.csv">available online</a>,
looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>person,lang,z1000t,z0t,z1000mem,stmtL,z1000rel,m1000rel,whours,caps

...
</code></pre></div>
<p>The columns hold the following information:</p>

</table>
<p>The <code>z1000rel</code> and <code>m1000rel</code> columns tell us that
all of these implementations are correct 98% of the time or better,
which is considered acceptable.
The rest of the data is much easier to understand as a <a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#box_and_whisker_plot" markdown="1">box-and-whisker plot</a>
of the working time in hours (the <code>whours</code> column from the table).
Each dot is a single data point
(<a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#jitter" markdown="1">jittered</a> up or down a bit to be easier to see).
The left and right boundaries of the box show the 25th and 75th <a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#percentile" markdown="1">percentiles</a> respectively,
i.e., 25% of the points lie below the box and 25% lie above it,
and the mark in the middle shows the <a class="gl-ref" href="../glossary/#median" markdown="1">median</a>
(<a class="fig-ref" href="../introduction/#introduction-boxplot">Figure 1.1</a>).</p>
<figure id="introduction-boxplot">
  <img src="./boxplot.svg" alt="Box-and-whisker plot show that most developers spent between zero and 20 hours but a few took as long as 63 hours."/>
  <figcaption markdown="1">Figure 1.1: Development Time</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So what does this data tell us about productivity?
As <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bibliography/#Prechelt2019">Prechelt2019</a>]</span> explains,
that depends on exactly what we mean.
The shortest and longest development times were 0.6 and 63 hours respectively,
giving a ratio of 105X.
However,
the subjects used seven different languages;
if we only look at those who used Java (about 30% of the whole)
the shortest and longest times are 3.8 and 63 hours,
giving a ratio of "only" 17X.</p>
<p>But comparing the best and the worst of anything is guaranteed to give us
an exaggerated impression of the difference.
If we compare the 75th percentile (which is the middle of the top half of the data)
to the 25th percentile (which is the middle of the bottom half)
we get a ratio of 18.5/7.25 or 2.55;
if we compare the 90th percentile to the 50th we get 3.7,
and other comparisons give us other values.
The answers to our original question are therefore:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It depends what you mean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, good programmers aren't 10 times more productive than average.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But yes, it's reasonable to say that they are about four times more productive.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The last point begs the question, "Why?"
The rest of this book offers some answers.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-audience">Section 1.2: Audience</h2>
<p>Every lesson should have specific learners in mind <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bibliography/#Wilson2019">Wilson2019</a>]</span>.
These <span class="ix-entry" ix-key="learner persona" markdown="1"><a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process-personas">personas</a></span> describe ours:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Yanina</em> is in the third year of a computer science degree.
    She worked on several volunteer projects in high school and at her mosque,
    but the "Introduction to Software Engineering" course she's about to take
    will be her first large team project at university.
    This book will help her and her teammates figure out what to do when and now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Brad</em> is in Yanina's classes.
    He can do many assignments in half the time it takes other students,
    which he attributes to innate aptitude
    rather than to his parents having sent him to after-school coding camps
    since he was nine years old.
    He finds discussion of what he calls "social justice bullshit" tiresome;
    this book will help him understand why that attitude is self-defeating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ahmadou</em> worked as an illustrator for several years
    before doing an intensive 14-week conversion course to become a JavaScript developer.
    He has a lot of experience working in teams to meet deadlines,
    but is still often bewildered by the tools, jargon, and culture of programming.
    This book will help him figure out what his programming colleagues think is "normal".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sharla</em> teaches JavaScript at Yanina's college
    and for the conversion course that Ahmadou went through.
    They taught the "Introduction to Software Engineering" class last semester,
    but felt their students wasted a lot of time on things that turned out not to be useful.
    This book will help them give more structure to the next offering
    and set more realistic expectations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like these personas, readers should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be able to write multi-page programs in Java, Python, JavaScript,
    or some other modern programming language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be able to create static web sites using HTML and CSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know how to create directories, delete files, and find things with the Unix shell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have used <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> on individual projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
