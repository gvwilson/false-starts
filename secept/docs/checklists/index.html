          <p>The first checklist below is a quick way to assess the health
of any small or medium-sized software project.
The second shows what larger teams look for in contributors.</p>
<h2 id="checklists-project">Section F.1: Project Evaluation</h2>
<p>Give your project 1 for each "yes",
0 for each "no",
and -1 for "I don't know" or "I don't understand the question".</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Does your project have a Code of Conduct and does everyone follow it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does your project have a vision statement and does everyone know what it is?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does every meeting start with an agenda and end with minutes filed somewhere findable?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is every project resource saved in version control?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you rebuild and deploy your project with a single command?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you write tests at the same time as you write code?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you always run your tests before checking changes into version control?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have a bug database and have you triaged it recently?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you use assertions and other defensive programming techniques?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you use a symbolic debugger to find problems?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you embed your documentation in your code?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a searchable archive of discussions about the project?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you use a style checker to maintain code consistency?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you do development in a distraction-free environment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you work steadily, without all-nighters or last-minute panic sessions?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How did you do?</p>
<dl>
<dt>5 or less</dt>
<dd>There is a lot of room for improvement,
but don't try to fix everything at once.
Instead, get the team to agree to tackle one thing at time.</dd>
<dt>6--10</dt>
<dd>Most mature development teams are in this range
and can bootstrap other improvements they need on their own.</dd>
<dt>11 or higher</dt>
<dd>If you're looking for a job, please let me know.
(Hell, if you're <em>hiring</em>, let me know that tooâ€¦)</dd>

<h2 id="checklists-individual">Section F.2: Individual Contribution</h2>
<p>The material below is adapted from the guidelines for annual performance reviews
at a well-known software development company.
It's an accurate depiction of what companies care about,
and can be used as a starting point for self-evaluation or peer evaluation in a project course.</p>
<h3>Software Engineering</h3>
<p>Includes technical design, architecture, coding, debugging, testing, performance
optimization, release, and maintenance.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Records technical requirements, architectural decisions, and other relevant information.</dt>
<dd>Does "just enough" design to answer all stakeholders' questions; analyzes
and reviews peers' designs; takes resource usage into account during design;
no "hidden features"; takes security needs into account.</dd>
<dt>Plans for evolution and maintenance.</dt>
<dd>Avoids excessive dependencies; allows for future maintenance; accounts for
deployment issues, particularly upgrades.</dd>
<dt>Uses configuration management system effectively.</dt>
<dd>All project-related material is versioned; never breaks the build; all
changes are connected to issues in an auditable way.</dd>
<dt>Uses issue tracking system effectively.</dt>
<dd>All questions, tasks, and bugs are issues; all work is associated with
issues; issues are kept up to date to serve as a basis for auditable status
reports; avoids creating redundant/duplicate issues.</dd>
<dt>Manages schedule.</dt>
<dd>Provides time estimates on work items, and updates completion estimates as
work progresses; proactively reports delays and other scheduling-related
issues to affected stakeholders; proactively searches for ways to reduce the
project's critical path.</dd>
<dt>Conforms to company coding guidelines.</dt>
<dd>Code always passes format checks; documentation of all inter-module and
externally-visible APIs is always up to date on main branch;
developer-oriented documentation phrased in terms of recognized design
patterns where relevant.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>Includes verbal communication, written reports, presentations, email, wikis,
blogs, active listening skills, feedback, and critiques.</p>

blocked; when asking for help, clearly and accurately explains what has been
tried, and why it didn't work.</dd>
<dt>Provides helpful feedback to peers.</dt>
<dd>Takes active role in design meetings, code reviews, etc.; provides specific
examples and suggestions for improvement when critiquing colleagues' work.</dd>
<dt>Improves efficiency.</dt>
<dd>Automates repetitive tasks through scripts, macros, etc.; proactively does
in-phase work that will reduce time and overhead in subsequent work phases.</dd>

<dd>Participates in relevant internal discussion groups; takes initiative to
establish contacts with colleagues in upstream and downstream groups.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Domain Expertise</h3>
