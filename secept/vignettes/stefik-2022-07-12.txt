Dude you are always welcome. For your consideration, I would consider this
one:

(I think my webpage properly bypasses the firewall
http://web.cs.unlv.edu/stefika/publications.html)

Here's the thing:

   1. Polyglot is a damned important issue I never see discussed. It's like
   97% of open source projects and we just blindly accept that it's fine. It's
   actually not fine though and it turns out to be a really complex issue

   2. Turns out, minor tweaks to how we many polyglot matter a lot and are
   *age* dependent (well, experience maybe, but they're related)

   3. There's a replication packet. Sometimes, our IRB doesn't allow raw
   anonymized data because they are picky, but I think they did for this one.
   Off the top of my head, Merlin (my ex Ph.D. student who has now graduated)
   has a docker instance to replicate the whole thing. So it's *very* easy
   to try and replicate compared to most studies

   4. It's in an evidence standard. Folks have to understand what that "is"
   (most don't, but nevermind), but if they "do" understand what that is, it's
   easy to know where everything is (the analogy I've thought about lately is
   that it's like design patterns, but for evidence. If you understand the
   standard, everything is easier to follow)
