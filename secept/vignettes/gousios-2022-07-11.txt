Hi Greg,

For my big data processing course, I had the following notebook, where I pa=
rtially replicated my ICSE 2014 pull request paper.=20

https://gousios.org/courses/bigdata/pullreqs.html

However, the emphasis here is using Spark for data science and ML learning =
purposes, which is probably not what you where thinking. Perhaps you could =
have your students replicate this code with scikit-learn etc and validate t=
he results of the original paper.

Hope this helps!

Georgios
