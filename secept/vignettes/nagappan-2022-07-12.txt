Hi Greg,

This might be the best paper:
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-017-9512-6

It has this dataset here: https://reporeapers.github.io/results/1.html

The whole dataset, training data, and validation data are also available.
They can train models described in the paper or come up with their own
models too. They can also get more data if they want, but that would be
quite hard. The CSV files would be a great start.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Mei

I think we do logistic regression. I do remember we did random forest. So they should be able to do that. K means is also a good way to see what groups of projects they get.
