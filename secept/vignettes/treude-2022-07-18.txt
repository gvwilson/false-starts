I think an easily accessible dataset from my work is related to our "Where
does Google find API documentation?" workshop paper from a few years ago:
https://ctreude.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/wapi18.pdf. The dataset is
already available online https://zenodo.org/record/1195863#.YtT49HZBze9

In addition to the research questions mentioned in the paper (Where does
Google find API documentation? Do resources found for recently introduced
API elements differ from the rest?), the same data could be used to
investigate questions such as, which parts of APIs are the least
documented? How does coverage on Stack Overflow and on GitHub correlate?
Which domains commonly appear together in search results (i.e., association
rule mining)?
