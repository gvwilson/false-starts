Looking back at my papers/data, I'm not sure I have any that fit well with
your specs. For example, the closest one might be the ICSE20 paper I did on
cross language interference where I had pulled Stack Overflow data on
several language pairs (co-tagged):

The analysis here was qualitative and a tad laborious, where Colton
(co-author) and I examined 30 SO posts for each pair assessing if there
were misconceptions based on the asker/answerer. By 3rd or 4th year,
students might have already interacted a ton with Stack Overflow googling
problems they have had in their coding assignments so it could be feasible
for them to do this analysis and see if they get different results? Let me
know what you think!

If it sounds like a good fit I can try to dig up the data for you.

Best,
Nischal
