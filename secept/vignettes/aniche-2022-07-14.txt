Hey Greg,

Thanks for your e-mail, and sorry for the late reply.

I never really did lots of MSR. I always preferred more qualitative
research. A few papers I have some data:

- [1] We studied atoms of confusion by means of a controlled
experiment with participants.
- [2] self vs peer grading, experimented in my own software testing course
- [3] code reviews in test files, are they different from reviews in
production code?
- [4] what linting rules do JS developers enable and disable in their
JSLint configurations?

The appendixes with data should all be available in the papers
themselves. I can't promise I remember everything, we did [4] in 2016,
and most of them were led by our PhD and MSc students, but I can try
and help.
