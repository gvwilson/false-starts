Thanks for reaching out - and no worries that it was out of the blue :-)

Table 2 on page 9 of this paper (also attached below) could be a candidate for such a vignette, maybe focusing on the relationship between formality and lifespan, effort, and the fact whether the sketch/diagram had been archived.

The correlations are between different properties of sketches and diagrams created for software development.
The correlations itself are not super surprising, but in the paper I complemented them with additional (qualitative) insights, e.g., in Sections 3.4 and 4.
The data (as CSV) as well as the R script that Iâ€™ve used are available here: https://empirical-software.engineering/supp/sketches/

Best regards,
Sebastian
