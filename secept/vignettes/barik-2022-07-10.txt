Hi Greg,

Probably the most applicable to what you are talking about would be the "Do developers read compiler error messages?" paper and the corresponding datasets:

https://static.barik.net/barik/gazerbeams/index.html

There are several "cleaned" datasets as CSV files that might be suitable for various interesting analysis. Some of the CSVs are probably small enough that you would not need to subset them.

You can try to recreate Table II, Figure 1, Figure 2, Table III or Figure 3.

This CSV has participants completing tasks and indicating whether they got it correct or not, the time they took, and so on:

This one looks at the titlebars of Eclipse, which can be used to identify what files people looked at, what order they looked at files, and so on:

There's some Eyetracking data along with which pane they were looking at:

Interestingly in my own paper I think some of the analysis was incorrect (or not done as properly as it could have been... dunno, I was still a student then :)). Siegmund and colleagues replicated my work here using the datasets I mentioned above:
