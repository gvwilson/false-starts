One paper that comes to mind would be this TSE 2020 collaboration with 
Shane McIntosh, comparing statement test coverage with flaky test coverage:
- Based on a CI data set we basically check to what extent one can trust 
statement test coverage, given that some of the tests covering the code 
might be flaky, and hence not trustworthy.
- This analysis uses simple stats and quantitative observations, and is 
followed by a relatively simple descriptive statistics analysis of 3 
"devil's advocate" hypotheses.
- There's also a replication package.

So, if you're still looking for a possible paper, this could be a 
possibility.
