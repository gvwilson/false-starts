Just a quick question: what will be the goal of the analysis?

In case, the teaching goal is to run a 2-faktor analysis, the ICSE study 
from 2014 could be feasible (the data is in the paper, 
https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2568225.2568299). In case the goal is to 
study some more slightly complex design, the N-of-1 study could help 
(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-021-10077-3,

Does it make sense from your perspective?

Best

----------------------------------------

Maybe just the idea of an alternative. I teach empirical methods here to CS students. But I mainly focus on experiment design and execution (and only do a quick intro into analysis).

I let students to simple experiments (such as "mouse vs. touchpad", "indentation", "syntax highlighting", i.e. one single student does one single experiment) that they repeat over and over again (first as N-of-1 experiments) before using their collegues as participants. The analysis is typically not that hard, but the "idea how to collect data" seems to be a harder task.

The analysis-part is typically just "click the right buttons in SPSS and tell me what these numbers mean".
