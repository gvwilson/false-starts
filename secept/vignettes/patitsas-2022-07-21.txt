Hi Greg,

Sorry, it's been too long since I did the analysis for that paper - I 
got the grades from UBC back in 2013.

There have been some replications of the paper though the only published 
one I know of is this one: 
https://www.ejmste.com/download/exploring-bimodality-in-introductory-computer-science-performance-distributions-5549.pdf 
(more may have been published since then)

If you're just looking for quant data sets with associated papers, I can 
offer the cleaned data & R code for this paper on what computer 
scientists report knowing about conflict minerals: 
https://computingwithinlimits.org/2021/papers/limits21-moreno.pdf - let 
me know if you'd want it.
