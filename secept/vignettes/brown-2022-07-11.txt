Hi Greg,

We have the slight problem that our data is not generally cleared for 
public access in the ethics, so it would need to be processed to a stage 
where it's broadly anonymous.

One paper that came to mind is one where we're just submitting the
final version to a journal (so should be published in a month or
two). I've attached it. I can send the data behind any of those graphs
(see end of paper) if that would help? However we didn't actually do
any statistical analysis as we were just exploring (I'd prefer to do
no tests than go fishing), so I don't know if that makes it a bad fit
for what you're thinking of.

Thanks,

Neil.
