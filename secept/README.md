# The Compassionate Programmer: evidence - process - tools

This textbook for an introductory undergraduate course on software engineering
differs from others in four ways:

1.  It teaches you to be a *compassionate programmer*:
    one who cares about the well-being of their colleagues and users
    as much as their own.

2.  It draws on *empirical studies* whenever possible.
    To help you understand those studies,
    its motivating examples are data analysis problems.

3.  It describes the *processes* professional programmers use
    and what students should aim for
    when they are juggling several courses at once.

4.  It introduces specific *tools* that support those processes.

Each chapter is designed to fill two lecture hours,
including time for discussion.
All the material can be re-used and remixed under open licenses.
Fixes and additions are very welcome;
please note that all contributors must abide by our Code of Conduct.

> We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.
