title: Accented characters not read properly in title of first column
labels: bug serious

- The spreadsheet attached has two rows and two columns.
  The first row is column titles and the second is data; all cells contain the word `ümlaut`.

- `read_sources(["example.xlsx"])` creates a dataframe with the right rows and columns,
  but the `ü` in the title of the first column appears as `u` (without the umlaut).
  The accented character is correct in all other cells.

- Downstream column merging in `collate_data()` is incorrect because of this mis-read,
  so we wind up with one extra column in the collated dataframe.
