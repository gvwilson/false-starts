title: "Conclusion"
---

Three books changed my life as a programmer.
[%b Kernighan1981 %] taught me I could do more than write softwareâ€”I
could *design* it.
[%b Glass2002 %] taught me we could study software and software development scientifically,
and [%b Hunt1999 %] taught me that building software was a craft like any other.

Looking at those books now,
I am struck by what they *don't* discuss.
How do you run a meeting in a way that ensures everyone is heard?
After forty years in tech,
I believe that is the most important skill I ever learned.
Why does our industry marginalize women,
people of color,
and members of the LGBT community
when all the evidence shows that more diverse teams are more productive?

Most importantly,
why do programmers keep building products that cause harm?
Given how online platforms have fueled radicalization and disinformation in ways that threaten us all,
shouldn't every guide to being a better programmer at least mention the problem?
This book can't answer all those questions,
but I hope it has encouraged you to think about them.
Thank you for reading.
