One of the strongest predictors
of whether or not a neurotypical adult learns something
is whether they are intrinsically motivated to learn it,
i.e.,
whether they're learning it to satisfy their own goals.
If someone is extrinsically motivated—for example,
if they're only taking a course because it's a degree requirement—the learning
probably won't stick [%b Wlodkowski2017 %].
While motivation is deeply personal,
these three factors influence most people:

Self-efficacy.
:   Also called self-determination,
    this is the degree to which you feel you are in control of your own life.
    People don't enjoy being treated like robots;
    anything the teacher does to put control back in their hands will increase engagement,
    and with it,
    learning.
    This is one of the reasons formative assessment works:
    if the teacher changes course to respond to students' answers,
    it shows students that they have some control over their lives.

Utility.
:   Students will learn more if they think the material is useful,
    but it has to be useful to *them*.
    One reason to create learner personas like the ones in [%x intro %]
    is to remind instructors of the second rule of teaching:
    "You are not your learners."
    (The first is, "Be kind.")

Community.
:   Most people prefer to learn things along with other people.
    (I can only dream of inspiring the same enthusiasm for programming
    as I see in baseball forums and fan discussions of *Avatar: The Last Airbender*.)

What about demotivation?
Again,
it turns out that the same few things turn most people off:

Unpredictability.
:   If what you do seems to have no effect on the outcome,
    you soon learn to stop trying.
    This is called learned helplessness,
    and anyone who has ever wrestled with an intermittent bug or a poorly-written grading rubric
    is familiar with it.

Unfairness.
:   If people believe that a game is rigged,
    they will all try less hard:
    the people who are favored will know they can slack off,
    while everyone else will see less point in trying [%b Wilkinson2011 %].

Indifference.
:   Most of us have had a teacher who didn't care whether we learned or not,
    and that kind of apathy is infectious.

These factors,
both positive and negative,
affect teams and team projects.
You may not be able to control all of them,
but whatever you *can* do will be repaid many times over.
