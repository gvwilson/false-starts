- Who does what

| Department         | Also Called | What It Does |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| Marketing          | Awareness   | Making people aware of who you're trying to help and how |
| Sales              | Adoption    | Getting people from "this looks interesting" to "we're using it" |
| Support            | Success     | Removing roadblocks and providing help |
| Human Resources    | Community   | Peer support and gathering feedback |
| Product Management | —           | Translate user pain into feature lists |
| Project Management | —           | Who should be working on what right now and what's stopping them |

- Another way to look at it

| Department         | What Risk It Addresses |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Marketing          | People don't know we exist or how we can help |
| Sales              | It's too hard to start using what we build |
| Support            | It's too hard to *keep* using what we build |
| Human Resources    | We don't have the right people to do the work |
| Product Management | We're building the wrong thing |
| Project Management | People aren't working on the right things or aren't working well together |
