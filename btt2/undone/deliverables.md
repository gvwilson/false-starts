Here are some of the things that you might be required to produce:

Requirements analysis
:   What the problem is,
    who the stakeholders are (i.e., who wants the problem solved),
    and what their needs are.

Design
:   What the user interface should look like,
    how data will flow through the system,
    what its major modules will be,
    and how they'll interact.

Application code
:   The software that will be delivered to the end user.
    This is inextricably entangled with:

Test code
:   Coding and testing should not be separate activities:
    doing them concurrently greatly improves your project's chances of success.

Documentation
:   Human-readable explanations of the software's structure and use.
    The first is intended for whoever inherits the software from you;
    the second, for its users.
    It is almost always a mistake to try to combine the two
    or to write them as if they were going to be read by the same people.

Packaging
:   A program is a piece of software that runs for you on your machine.
    A product is a piece of software that will run for anyone on *their* machine.
    Products take longer to build than programs:
    the packaging needed to let someone else download, install, configure, and run the program
    has often not been covered in software engineering courses,
    but good instructors will insist that you create it.

Deployment
:   The project's aim might not be to create something that can be downloaded and installed.
    Instead, its aim might be to create a web site or web service or make something else directly available to users.
    Like packaging,
    deployment can be a major development issue in its own right,
    and the effort required to do it is almost always underestimated.

Handoff
:   If you don't put effort into passing the project on to whoever comes after you,
    your hard work will almost certainly count for nought.
    While it isn't usual for undergraduate projects to be handed on from one term to another,
    some courses require teams to swap code mid-term.
    If this happens,
    instructors may grade you on how complete and up-to-date your wiki pages,
    bug database, and build scripts are at the time of handoff.

Review
:   The only way to get better at something is to reflect on how you've done and what you could have done better.
    Every project should therefore end with a postmortem
    in which team members talk about what went right and what went wrong.
    As mentioned earlier, this may then be the subject of the final report.
