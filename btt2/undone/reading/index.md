In my experience, the best approach to learning your way around a new code
base is to trace what happens during a typical operation.  What functions or
methods are called in what order as an HTTP request is processed?  What
objects are created?  What changes are made to files or databases, if any?
The "step over" button your debugger is a very useful tool for this
(FIXME), since it allows you ignore low-level details while you're
trying to paint a bigger picture.
