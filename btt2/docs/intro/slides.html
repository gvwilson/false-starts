</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Programming is often portrayed as a solitary activity</li>
<li>But real applications are always the work of many people</li>
<li>Aim of this course is therefore to show you how to build software in a team</li>
<li>And to help you become a <em>compassionate programmer</em><ul>
<li>One who cares about the wellbeing of their colleagues,
    their users,
    and society as a whole.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What you do to help others helps your future self</li>
<li>More importantly,
    now that we know how much harm software can do,
    we need to build it better</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Audience</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Yani</em> is a third year CS student doing her first team project<ul>
<li>Help her and her teammates figure out who should do what, when</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Sharla</em> teaches Yani&rsquo;s software engineering class<ul>
<li>Help them restructure that course to be more satisfying</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>We Know More Than You Realize</h2>
<ul>
<li>Empirical studies of programs, programmers, and programming date back more than fifty years</li>
<li>Findings are rarely discussed in undergraduate classes<ul>
<li>So most books on programming are a mix of personal experience and received wisdom</li>
<li>Which is usually just someone else&rsquo;s personal experience repackaged as a universal truth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We cite research where we can</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h2>Why Does Everything Take So Long?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Software projects have nine types of waste <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Sedano2017">Sedano2017</a>]</span></li>
</ul>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>building the wrong thing</td>
      <td>mismanaging the backlog</td>
      <td>rework</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>unnecessarily complex solutions</td>
      <td>extraneous cognitive load</td>
      <td>psychological distress</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>waiting and multitasking</td>
      <td>knowledge loss</td>
      <td>ineffective communication</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<ul>
<li>None of these are software issues</li>
<li>If you only think about code and not about who writes it and how,
    everything will take longer and hurt more than it needs to</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Programming as a Human Activity</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing in software engineering makes sense except in the light of psychology.</p>
<p>â€” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_in_Biology_Makes_Sense_Except_in_the_Light_of_Evolution">Theodosius Dobzhansky</a> (modified)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Our mental capability is limited <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Hermans2021">Hermans2021</a>]</span></li>
<li>Our designs and development processes have to take these limits into account</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sociotechnical Congruence</h2>
<ul>
<li>The software we build is shaped by the organizations that build it
    and shapes them in turn <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Cataldo2008">Cataldo2008</a>]</span><ul>
<li>How you run meetings determines whose opinions are heard,
    which in turn determines the architecture that emerges from those meetings</li>
<li>How programmers are evaluated
    determines whether they thrive in their jobs or not <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Hicks2023">Hicks2023</a>]</span></li>
<li>The tools that allow people to build communities online
    are used to amplify hate for profit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We cannot understand programs and programming
    unless we understand organizations as well as individuals</li>
</ul>
