      <h2 id="summary-intro"><a href="../intro">Introduction</a> (<a href="../intro/slides.html">slides</a>)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to help you become a compassionate programmer.</li>
<li>Nothing in software engineering makes sense except in the light of psychology.</li>
<li>We know more about programs, programmers, and programming from empirical studies than most people realize.</li>
<li>Good programmers aren&rsquo;t ten times more productive than average, but it&rsquo;s fair to say they are four times better.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-cogload"><a href="../cogload">Cognitive Load</a> (<a href="../cogload/slides.html">slides</a>)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our <strong>long-term memory</strong> is large but slow, and we don&rsquo;t have direct access to it.</li>
<li>Our <strong>short-term memory</strong> is fast but small: it can hold roughly 7Â±2 things at once.</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive load theory</strong> distinguishes between intrinsic, germane, and extraneous load.</li>
<li><strong>Chunking</strong> ideas together according to patterns effectively expands short-term memory.</li>
<li><strong>Novices</strong>, <strong>competent practitioners</strong>, and <strong>experts</strong> think differently and need to be taught differently.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-meetings"><a href="../meetings">Meetings</a> (<a href="../meetings/slides.html">slides</a>)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Meet to do status updates and make decisions, not to share information.</li>
<li>Have clear rules for making decisions.</li>
<li>Have an agenda and take minutes.</li>
<li>Choose a moderator to keep people on track and on time.</li>
<li>No interruptions.</li>
<li>Progress, plans, and problems go up, context and priorities come down.</li>
<li>Do not record the meeting without willing consent.</li>
<li>Avoid mixed-mode meetings: they are unfair to remote participants.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-decomp"><a href="../decomp">Who Does What</a> (<a href="../decomp/slides.html">slides</a>)</h2>
<ul>
<li>People learn better together than alone <em>if</em> their teams are working well.</li>
<li><strong>Stream-aligned teams</strong> works on a single product, service, or set of features.</li>
<li><strong>Enabling team</strong> is specialists in a particular domain who help stream-aligned teams solve specific problems.</li>
<li><strong>Complicated subsystem team</strong> builds and maintains modules for stream-aligned teams to use.</li>
<li><strong>Platform team</strong> creates internal services to allow stream-aligned teams to work consistently but independently.</li>
<li>Can be hard for some teams or individuals to get recognition for their work.</li>
<li><strong>Modular decomposition</strong> leads to big bang integration and makes each person a single point of failure.</li>
<li><strong>Functional decomposition</strong> has the same problems plus uneven distribution of annoyance.</li>
<li><strong>Feature decomposition</strong> and <strong>rotating decomposition</strong> are fairer but doesn&rsquo;t allow people to dive deep into any skill.</li>
<li>Avoid allowing high-status individuals to snag most prestigious roles: they&rsquo;re often not as good as they think they are.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-teaming"><a href="../teaming">Forming and Reforming Teams</a> (<a href="../teaming/slides.html">slides</a>)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Having students of varying abilities in every team helps everyone.</li>
<li>The biggest challenge for student teams is finding time to work together.</li>
<li>Avoid isolating at-risk students when forming teams.</li>
<li><strong>One by One</strong> reorganization is the most common way to reorganize teams.</li>
<li><strong>Grow and Split</strong> helps teams regain efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Merging</strong> is common as work or larger organization changes over time.</li>
<li><strong>Isolation</strong> can be used to solve a single problem, but team members must bring knowledge back to the group quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Switching</strong> team members can prevent stagnation and reduce lottery factor, but there is always a learning overhead.</li>
<li>People may have both valid and invalid reasons for not wanting to be on teams with specific other people.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-grading"><a href="../grading">Grading</a> (<a href="../grading/slides.html">slides</a>)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Measuring programmers&rsquo; productivity is hard and depends on context.</li>
<li>Developers are most productive when they&rsquo;re thriving, which depends on four factors.</li>
<li><strong>Agency</strong>: have a voice in how they&rsquo;re measured and can disagree with team definitions of success.</li>
<li><strong>Motivation and self-efficacy</strong>: motivated by problems, can see tangible progress, doing the work they want to do, and confident they can solve problems even when they&rsquo;re hard.</li>
<li><strong>Learning culture</strong>: learning new skills and able to share what they&rsquo;re learning.</li>
<li><strong>Support and belonging</strong>: accepted for who they are and able to grow, learn, and make mistakes.</li>
<li>Being graded while juggling several courses works against all of these, but society isn&rsquo;t willing to invest enough resources to support other forms of feedback.</li>
<li>Much easier to grade artefacts than processes, but ignoring the latter devalues <strong>invisible work</strong>.</li>
<li>Organizations prefer everyone to do things the same way, even if it&rsquo;s less productive, because it&rsquo;s easier to manage.</li>
<li>No one has invented a meaningful measure of code quality.</li>
<li>Peer evaluation can be gamed, and is subject to conscious and unconscious bias.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s unfair to ask people to assess each other or each other&rsquo;s work if they have not been trained to do so.</li>
</ul>
