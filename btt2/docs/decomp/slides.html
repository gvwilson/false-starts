  <a href="">Building Tech Together</a>
</p>
<h1>Who Does What</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most people learn better together than alone  <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Michaelson2004">Michaelson2004</a>]</span></li>
<li><em>If</em> their team works well together</li>
<li>Good meetings are necessary but not sufficient (Chapter&nbsp;3)</li>
<li>Also have to decide who&rsquo;s doing what</li>
<li>And how to decide who&rsquo;s going to do what</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<!--# class="aside" -->

<h2>Agreement Matters Most</h2>
<ul>
<li>Roles can be fluid</li>
<li>Most important thing is that team members understand and accept their responsibilities
    and everyone else&rsquo;s <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Barke2019">Barke2019</a>]</span></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>What We&rsquo;re Simulating</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Skelton2019">Skelton2019</a>]</span> describes four ways to organize teams</li>
<li>Apply directly to software companies and research labs</li>
<li>Teams in courses should simulate</li>
</ul>
<figure id="topologies-topologies">
<img src="./topologies.svg" alt="Four kinds of teams: stream-aligned, enabling, platform, and complicated subsystem"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure&nbsp;1: Four kinds of teams.</figcaption>
</figure>

<hr />
<h2>Stream-Aligned Team</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stream (n.) &ldquo;the continuous flow of work aligned to a business domain or organizational capability&rdquo;</li>
<li>
<p>So a <strong>stream-aligned team</strong> works on a single product, service, or set of features</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define clear boundaries for what it&rsquo;s building</p>
</li>
<li>Produce a steady flow of features and fixes</li>
<li>Reach out to support teams as necessary</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Enabling Team</h2>
<ul>
<li>Specialists in a particular domain,
    e.g. accessibility or performance optimization</li>
<li>
<p>Helps stream-aligned teams that encounter problems they can&rsquo;t solve themselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to understand the needs of stream-aligned teams
    (rather than saying, &ldquo;I have a hammer, so your problem must be a nail&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>Learn about new tools and methods
    <em>before</em> stream-aligned teams run into problems that need them</li>
<li>Share knowledge as the border between specialized and common-place shifts</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<!--# class="aside" -->

<h2>Boundaries Move</h2>
<ul>
<li>Virtualization and cloud deployment used to be specialized skills</li>
<li>Now part of most developers&rsquo; everyday lives</li>
<li>Enabling teams recognize these shifts and (re-)train members of stream-aligned teams</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Complicated Subsystem Team</h2>
<ul>
<li>Counterparts of enabling teams</li>
<li>Builds and maintains modules for product teams to use
    that they can&rsquo;t (easily) build for themselves</li>
<li>Biggest responsibility is to build the right thing</li>
<li>Very easy for subsystem teams to build what&rsquo;s technically interesting
    rather than what&rsquo;s useful</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Platform Team</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create internal services to keep everything else moving</li>
<li>In particular,
    allow stream-aligned teams to work consistently but independently<ul>
<li>Common for teams to choose different tools or methods to solve the same problem</li>
<li>Creates maintenance and integration headaches down the road</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Getting recognition for work is a challenge for enabling and platform teams<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Nobody thinks about the sewer system until the toilet doesn&rsquo;t flush&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unethical to recommend breaking things on purpose occasionally
    to remind everyone you exist…</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<figure id="topologies-interactions">
<img src="./interactions.svg" alt="Three kinds of interaction: collaboration, facilitation, and X-as-a-service"/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure&nbsp;2: Interactions between different kinds of teams.</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>Collaboration: close partnership, usually between two teams at a time</li>
<li>X-as-a-service: one team acts as a customer for another<ul>
<li>Some organizations have one team buy services from another,
    which makes work visible but discourages collaboration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Facilitating: enabling team partners with stream-aligned team
    long enough to get obstacle out of the way</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Adaptation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Team Topologies model makes sense with multiple collaborating teams over long time</li>
<li>But courses are short…</li>
<li>…collaboration between teams makes evaluation much harder (Chapter&nbsp;6)…</li>
<li>…and the point of a course is for people to learn</li>
<li>Want a model that prepares for the one above but works in the classroom</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Three Axes of Division</h2>
<figure id="decomp-division">
<img src="./division.svg" alt="Modular, functional, and feature decomposition."/>
<figcaption markdown="1">Figure&nbsp;1: Dividing work in a software team.</figcaption>
</figure>

<ol>
<li>Layer of software (modular)</li>
<li>Kind of work (functional)</li>
<li>Value being delivered (feature)</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Modular Decomposition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each person is responsible for one module of the program<ul>
<li>UI, data analysis, back-end interaction with database, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having people own parts of the code produces lower failure rates in industry <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Bird2011">Bird2011</a>]</span></li>
<li>A bad strategy in a course:<ol>
<li>Leads to <strong>big bang integration</strong>, which almost always fails</li>
<li>Each team member only understands one module,
    so everyone is a single point of failure.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Functional Decomposition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each person is responsible for one type of task<ul>
<li>Design, coding, testing, deployment, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once again,
    everyone is a single point of failure</li>
<li>Unidirectional flow of annoyance:
    downstream team members have to live with whatever upstream team members decide to do</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Feature Decomposition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each team member handles all aspects of development for one feature at a time</li>
<li>Gives everyone a chance to practice all their skills</li>
<li>But no one gets as far in any particular specialty</li>
<li>And integrating features developed in parallel can be painful</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Rotating Decomposition</h2>
<ul>
<li>People fill one role for a couple of weeks,
    a different role for the next two weeks,
    etc.</li>
<li>Resilient in the face of team turnover</li>
<li>And more people can participate in design/debugging sessions</li>
<li>But everyone is always ramping up</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<!--# class="aside" -->

<h2>Chaotic Decomposition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately the most common approach in practice</li>
<li>Some things done multiple times or not at all</li>
<li>All other decompositions tend toward chaos under pressure</li>
<li>So establish good habits early</li>
<li>And stick to them when workload is light</li>
<li>So that the instinct to do the right thing will be there when you need it</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>One Other Reason</h2>
<ul>
<li>If teams use modular or functional decomposition,
    self-appointed alpha geeks often snag the high-status work<ul>
<li>Shoulder people who aren&rsquo;t as pushy, privileged, or self-confident into lower-status roles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lowers the team&rsquo;s overall grade<ul>
<li>Female students&rsquo; ranking of fellow students is generally accurate</li>
<li>Male students consistently over-estimate their male peers <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Grunspan2016">Grunspan2016</a>]</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<!--# class="aside" -->

<h2>Confirmation Loops</h2>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_work">Women&rsquo;s work</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_issues_faced_by_black_quarterbacks">quarterback syndrome</a>&ldquo;<ul>
<li>Two thirds of NFL players are Black but 83% of quarterbacks are white</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Writing operating systems or training AI models
    has higher status than building user interfaces</li>
<li>People doing the former are both paid more and more likely to be male
    than people doing the latter,
    regardless of ability or value delivered to the employer</li>
<li>Creates a feedback loop:<ul>
<li>White/Asian men pursue careers with high status</li>
<li>The fact that they are pursuing those careers maintains that status</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Creates a confirmation loop<ul>
<li>Women and people of color get fewer chances to do certain tasks</li>
<li>So they are less good at them, which &ldquo;confirms&rdquo; the initial bias</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>&ldquo;But I Haven&rsquo;t Seen That&rdquo;</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some people have experienced this so often that
    they have come to accept it as the price they have to pay for being in tech</li>
<li>Those who protest are often dismissed as being &ldquo;difficult&rdquo;</li>
<li>Many take a third path and decide to leave the field<ul>
<li>Why play a game that&rsquo;s unfair?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Survivor bias</strong> </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<!--# class="aside" -->

<h2>It Wasn&rsquo;t Always Thus</h2>
<ul>
<li>Programming was originally considered a female occupation</li>
<li>Only came to be viewed as a male occupation when it became more lucrative
    <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Abbate2012">Abbate2012</a>, <a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Ensmenger2012">Ensmenger2012</a>, <a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Hicks2018">Hicks2018</a>]</span></li>
<li>What is &ldquo;normal&rdquo; changes over time</li>
<li>And can be changed deliberately</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<!--# class="exercise" -->

<h2>Division of Labor</h2>
<ol>
<li>What are the pros and cons of your team trying
    two or more methods of work decomposition during your project?</li>
<li>Since you&rsquo;ll only have time to try each once,
    and will be doing each for the time time,
    how will you know which struggles are intrinsic to the method
    and which are <strong>learning effects</strong>?</li>
<li>Some schools have upper-year students act as team leads
    for groups in lower-year courses.
    What are the pros and cons of this approach?</li>
</ol>
