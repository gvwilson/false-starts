<h1>Forming and Reforming Teams</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chapter&nbsp;4 described what teams look like, but where do they come from?</li>
<li>Need strategies for organizing people into teams</li>
<li>And for reorganizing those teams as needs and people change over time.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Creating Teams</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many students prefer to select their teammates<ul>
<li>And students with high grades tend to want teammates with similar grades</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But having students with a range of grades in the same team
    either has no effect or improves outcomes <em>for everyone</em>
    <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Mosher2013">Mosher2013</a>, <a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Donovan2018">Donovan2018</a>, <a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Farland2019">Farland2019</a>, <a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Auvinen2020">Auvinen2020</a>]</span></li>
<li>Weak students get coaching from stronger teammates</li>
<li>Stronger students learn by explaining<ul>
<li>An opportunity to re-think things or see them in a new light</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Because I Said So</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most powerful argument for instructors allocating people to teams
    is that&rsquo;s how it works in the real world<ul>
<li>You probably won&rsquo;t get to pick your colleagues
    if you join a company or a research group</li>
<li>Though &ldquo;I want to work with y&rsquo;all&rdquo; is a great reason to start a company</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your performance depends as much on getting along with other people
    as it does on technical ability</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Calendar Nightmares</h2>
<ul>
<li>Biggest headache in forming student teams is scheduling</li>
<li>Work-from-home has made this easier…</li>
<li>…but most students are juggling several courses with overlapping demands on time</li>
<li>Small class:
    have each student share their availability and form groups by inspection</li>
<li>Large class:
    need software support<ul>
<li>Course timetabling software usually doesn&rsquo;t work well for this</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Twice a Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Goal is to have one block of at least 90 minutes each week for group work</li>
<li>Plus a separate block of 30 minutes for status meeting</li>
<li>Do <em>not</em> schedule the two meetings back-to-back<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What are we supposed to be doing now?&rdquo; will become muddy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Accommodations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid isolating at-risk students
    (e.g., women and members of racialized minority groups)<ul>
<li>More likely to drop out than other students due to feeling isolated</li>
<li>Putting at-risk students together can mitigate this problem <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Margolis2002">Margolis2002</a>]</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some people are early birds while others are night owls<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Do you prefer to work in the morning or the evening?&rdquo;
    can be surprisingly effective</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Reteaming</h2>
<ul>
<li>Work and people change over time<ul>
<li>And sometimes team members just don&rsquo;t get along</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Helfand2020">Helfand2020</a>]</span> lays out five patterns for reorganizing teams</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t all come up in undergraduate course projects
    but are common in research teams, open source, and on the job</li>
<li>Like most advice about teamwork they sound obvious when you hear them, but:<ul>
<li>having names for things helps us talk about them, and</li>
<li>saying that something is obvious in retrospect
    isn&rsquo;t the same as saying you&rsquo;d have thought of it yourself</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>One by One</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add or remove one person at a time</li>
<li>Most common pattern</li>
<li>Steps to take:<ul>
<li>Define career ladders or equivalent ways to progress</li>
<li>Make the new people welcome</li>
<li>Ask them for their ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<!--# class="aside" -->

<h2>Reorganizing</h2>
<ul>
<li>During large reorganizations (almost) every team gains or loses one or two people</li>
<li>In this case it&rsquo;s better to think of the teams as re-forming entirely</li>
<li>The stability normally provided by neighboring teams <em>not</em> changing
    isn&rsquo;t there to keep this one anchored</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Grow and Split</h2>
<ul>
<li>As teams get larger they become less efficient</li>
<li>Splitting team is a way to regain efficiency</li>
<li>Steps to take:<ul>
<li>Let experienced team members decide</li>
<li>Recognize that every rule has exceptions</li>
<li>Divide responsibilities as well as teams</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Merging</h2>
<ul>
<li>Inverse of Grow and Split</li>
<li>Usually followed by moving some people to other teams
    to keep the new team&rsquo;s size manageable</li>
<li>Also happens after one company acquires another<ul>
<li>Though people are often laid off rather than being moved to new teams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steps to take:<ul>
<li>Combine teams as projects wind down</li>
<li>Distinguish mergers from takeovers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Isolation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Put a few people together temporarily to solve a single problem free from distraction<ul>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t come up often in courses</li>
<li>Nowhere to bring the knowledge back <em>to</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steps to take:<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t create silos</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t make it a status badge</li>
<li>Bring the knowledge back quickly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Switching</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shuffle team membership to prevent stagnation</li>
<li>Reduces group&rsquo;s lottery factor</li>
<li>Be cautious<ul>
<li>consultants and newly-hired managers often launch re-organizations
    just to show that they&rsquo;re doing something</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Steps to take:<ul>
<li>Base changes on individual aspirations</li>
<li>Allow people to avoid teams if they&rsquo;re willing to explain why in private</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<!--# class="aside" -->

<h2>Finding the Balance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some people have good reasons to want to avoid other people<ul>
<li>Female students might drop a course rather than be on a team with &ldquo;that guy&rdquo;</li>
<li>Members of minoritized groups don&rsquo;t want to have to work with racists</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But each of these reasons can be turned around:<ul>
<li>Misogynist might not want any women on his team</li>
<li>Racists don&rsquo;t want to have to work with &ldquo;those people&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hard to distinguish &ldquo;our working styles are different&rdquo;
    from &ldquo;he&rsquo;s deeply unpleasant&rdquo;
    from &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually the unpleasant one&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<!--# class="exercise" -->

<h2>Who&rsquo;s in Charge?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Suppose the instructor assigns students to teams.
    How should the team figure out who (singular or plural) is going to organize meetings,
    allocate work,
    etc.?</li>
<li>Suppose the instructor says that one student from each team
    will be reallocated to another team every two weeks (or for every assignment).
    What are the benefits and drawbacks of doing this?</li>
<li>Suppose the instructor creates a chat room for the course
    where people can post complaints about their teammates anonymously.
    Who does this help? Who does this harm?</li>
</ol>
