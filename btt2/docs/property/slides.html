<h1>Intellectual Property</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Pop Quiz</h2>
<p>Which of these do you believe?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As a student,
    you own the software you write for course assignments.
    If the university wants to use it,
    they need your permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You own the software you write for course assignments
    <em>as long as you do the work on your own computer</em>.
    If you use a university&rsquo;s machines,
    they have an equal right to the software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are an undergrad paying fees,
    you own what you write,
    but if you are a grad student being paid a stipend,
    the university owns it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>And the Answer Is…</h2>
<ul>
<li>It depends where you are</li>
<li>Different schools have different rules<ul>
<li>Even in the same legal jurisdiction</li>
<li>And some universities&rsquo; rules also depend on which faculty you&rsquo;re in</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rules in industry are usually less complex<ul>
<li>Anything you do on company time or with company resources belongs to the company</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But there are many gray areas</li>
<li>I wrote some of this material on a company laptop while traveling for work<ul>
<li>Do I owe my employer a share of the royalties?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What if I developed a computer virus on that same computer at the same time?<ul>
<li>Would the company &ldquo;own&rdquo; that?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>One Right Among Many</h2>
<ul>
<li>Who owns what is just one of the rights that societies recognize</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> includes the rights to:<ul>
<li>say what you want</li>
<li>live free from fear,</li>
<li>be treated the same way as everyone else regardless of race,
    sex, orientation, religion, or disability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most countries have signed this declaration,
    so in theory it has the force of law</li>
<li>But the words &ldquo;in theory&rdquo; are doing a lot of work in that sentence</li>
<li>And software is changing everything faster than legislation and practice can keep up with</li>
<li>First step toward ensuring your rights is to know what they are and where they come from</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h2>It Wasn&rsquo;t Always Thus</h2>
<ul>
<li>Until early modern times, only kings and queens &ldquo;owned&rdquo; land <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Linklater2013">Linklater2013</a>]</span><ul>
<li>Everyone else had the right to <em>use</em> the land in certain ways</li>
<li>Or to forbid other people from using it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The modern idea of &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; is the result of centuries of conflict
    between European and British/American law <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Baldwin2014">Baldwin2014</a>]</span><ul>
<li>First established to <em>limit</em> printers&rsquo; control over books <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Bellos2024">Bellos2024</a>]</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And our preoccupation with human rights might just be a case of &ldquo;last good idea standing&rdquo; <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Moyn2010">Moyn2010</a>]</span></li>
<li>Which means that <em>none of what follows is natural or inevitable</em></li>
<li>Property rights evolved over several centuries
    to address the economic and moral concerns
    of people powerful enough to influence law-making</li>
<li>Are constantly changing as power shifts and needs change</li>
<li>And programmers have caused a lot of the recent changes</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<ul>
<li>Covers four separate kinds of rights</li>
<li>What ties them together is that information is expensive to produce but cheap to copy</li>
<li>Each kind of IP gives its holder a limited monopoly over some kind of information</li>
<li>In theory,
    ensures that creators can earn enough from producing intangible goods to keep doing it</li>
<li>In practice,
    often used as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking">rent-seeking</a> (discussed below)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Copyright</h2>
<ul>
<li>Copyrights apply to any original expression that anyone creates<ul>
<li>Can&rsquo;t (yet) copyright facts,</li>
<li>But can copyright <em>representation</em> of facts that contains an element of creativity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="fixme" markdown="1">examples of copyright and its abuses</span></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Patents</h2>
<ul>
<li>Apply to inventions, technological improvements, and business methods</li>
<li>Grant a monopoly for a fixed period of time (usually twenty years)<ul>
<li>I.e., no one can use the idea without the patent holder&rsquo;s permission</li>
<li>Which they can charge for</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stronger than copyright, so requirements for obtaining a patent are more stringent<ul>
<li>Can take years, thousands of pages of paperwork, and many thousands of dollars</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intended to be a bargain between the inventor and the public<ul>
<li>Inventor discloses how the invention works so that other people can learn from it</li>
<li>Society ensures that she is the only one who can profit from it for a reasonable time</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Trade Secret</h2>
<ul>
<li>If someone doesn&rsquo;t want anyone to know how her invention works
    she can treat it as a trade secret</li>
<li>Not a property right as such,
    but rather the practice of relying on things like non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)
    to keep something secret.</li>
<li>Less risk of someone being inspired by your idea to create something better</li>
<li>But if the idea <em>does</em> leak, the inventor has less legal protection</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Trademark</h2>
<ul>
<li>People have limited time to make decisions</li>
<li>So brands lower the cost of choice<ul>
<li>If company XYZ has a reputation for high quality or low prices,
    the name itself has commercial value</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A trademark is the exclusive right to a brand</li>
<li><span class="fixme" markdown="1">more about trademarks and their use</span></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>What Is Software?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not immediately clear which category software falls into<ul>
<li>IBM had to be threatened with legal action to admit that
    its software had value separate from the value of its hardware
    <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Grad2002">Grad2002</a>]</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is it a document that can be copyrighted?</li>
<li>Is it an invention that can be patented?</li>
<li>Can algorithms be patented?<ul>
<li>If so, can mathematical proofs and the laws of science?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Software Licenses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dictates how software can be used and redistributed</li>
<li>Every creative work automatically has some sort of license<ul>
<li>The only questions are whether authors and users know what it is and choose to enforce it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choosing a license can be complex <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Lindberg2008">Lindberg2008</a>]</span></li>
<li>To avoid messiness:<ol>
<li>Every project should include an explicit license</li>
<li>This license should be chosen early (changing later can be complicated)</li>
<li>The license should be written by professionals,
    since implications of legal language are not obvious to non-experts <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Almeida2017">Almeida2017</a>]</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Open Licenses</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> maintains <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">a list</a> of open licenses</li>
<li><a href="https://choosealicense.com/">choosealicense.com</a> can help you find the right one</li>
<li>MIT and BSD Licenses<ol>
<li>People can do whatever they want to with the software…</li>
<li>…as long as they cite the original source…</li>
<li>and the authors accept no responsibility if things go wrong</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>GNU Public License (GPL) gives people similar rights
    but requires them to share their own work on the same terms<ul>
<li>I.e., if someone modifies GPL-licensed software or incorporates it into their own project
    and then distributes what they have created,
    they have to distribute the source code for their own work as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<!--# class="aside" -->

<h2>Behind the License Wars</h2>
<ul>
<li>GPL was created to prevent companies from taking advantage of open software
    without contributing anything back</li>
<li>The last 35 years have shown that this restriction isn&rsquo;t necessary<ul>
<li>Many projects have survived and thrived without this safeguard</li>
<li>And GPL&rsquo;d projects are no more or less sustainable than other projects</li>
<li>But &ldquo;GPL or Die!&rdquo; is a <strong>shibboleth</strong> for some programmers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Hippocratic License forbids use of software
    in ways that violate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a><ul>
<li>Some people who are in favor of the GPL&rsquo;s restrictions on use
    argue that the HL&rsquo;s restrictions mean it isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;real&rdquo; open license</li>
<li>Which says more about them than it does about the licenses</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Creative Commons Licenses</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most widely used set of open licenses for data and written work
    are those produced by <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a></li>
<li>Most liberal option is CC0 (the &ldquo;0&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;zero restrictions&rdquo;)<ul>
<li>Puts work in the public domain,
    i.e.,
    allows anyone who wants to use it to do so however they want with no restrictions.</li>
<li>The best choice for data,
    since it simplifies aggregation of datasets from different sources</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Creative Commons License (cont.)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creative Commons-Attribution license (CC-BY):
    do whatever you want but cite the original source<ul>
<li>Best license to use for papers and reports</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other licenses have some mix of further restrictions</li>
<li>NC (no commercial use) does <em>not</em> mean people can&rsquo;t charge money for their work<ul>
<li>Actually means &ldquo;you need my permission to use this if you&rsquo;re making money from it&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ND (no derivative works) prevents people from creating modified versions<ul>
<li>Unfortunately also inhibits translation and reformatting</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SA (share-alike) requires people to share anything that incorporates the work
    on the same terms as the original<ul>
<li>In practice makes aggregation and recombination difficult</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h2>Why Be Open?</h2>
<ul>
<li>85% of all interesting innovations in all industries come from users rather than suppliers
    <span class="bib-ref">[<a class="bib-ref" href="../bib/#Hippel2006">Hippel2006</a>]</span></li>
<li>The more open work is,
    the more people can tinker with it
    and do things the original creators would never have thought of</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<!--# class="aside" -->

<h2>Why <em>Aren&rsquo;t</em> We Open?</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking">Rent-seeking</a>
    and other forms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_scarcity">artificial scarcity</a>
    can be very profitable<ul>
<li>Bad for society as a whole</li>
<li>But good for individuals with the legal power to extract money
    without having to add value</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act">Mickey Mouse Protection Act</a>,
    which extended the duration of copyright in the US yet again,
    was the result of intensive lobbying by Disney</li>
<li>An example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">regulatory capture</a><ul>
<li>Copyright extension is a high priority for a company that can spend a lot of money</li>
<li>Fighting it is a lower priority for people who individually can&rsquo;t spend as much</li>
<li>Regulations wind up being shaped primarily by the former at the expense of the latter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who Owns Your Work?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Who owns the software your team produces in this course?
    How easy was it to find an answer?</li>
<li>Suppose that a project has released three versions of a software package
    under the GPL,
    but now wants to switch to the MIT License.
    What steps must it take to do this?
    Whose permission is needed (i.e., who can say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and make it stick)?</li>
<li>Microsoft (which owns GitHub) trains AI models using the source code in students&rsquo; repositories.
    If you add a license to your repository saying that
    your software cannot be used directly or indirectly for commercial purposes
    without your express prior permission,
    can you then demand a share of Microsoft&rsquo;s revenue from its AI ventures?</li>
</ol>
