-   "Our **long-term memory** is large but slow, and we don't have direct access to it."
-   "Our **short-term memory** is fast but small: it can hold roughly 7Â±2 things at once."
-   "**Cognitive load theory** distinguishes between intrinsic, germane, and extraneous load."
-   "**Chunking** ideas together according to patterns effectively expands short-term memory."
-   "**Novices**, **competent practitioners**, and **experts** think differently and need to be taught differently."
