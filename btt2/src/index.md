## Motivation

I'm trying to figure out
how to persuade a 20-year-old straight white/Asian male programmer
who has grown up watching toxic YouTube videos
to care about ethics, equity, and social responsibility
rather than dismissing the topics as "woke".
What I'd like to try is
embedding discussion of things that matter
in an undergrad course about building software in teams
as a way of smuggling ideas past knee-jerk defenses.
For example,
"how to run a meeting" leads naturally to "how to manage interruptions",
which in turn motivates discussion of who interrupts whom in our society,
while the problem of grading team projects in a fair way
leads to ideas from Scott's *Seeing Like a State*.

The challenge is
to match things that students and instructors believe belong in a software engineering course
with bigger ideas.
Can a lesson on intellectual property segue into a discussion of regulatory capture
without feeling clumsy and obvious?
How about a discussion of roles in teamsâ€”can that be a pretext
for talking about invisible work and preparatory privilege?
If so,
can the transition from one to the other be made seamless enough to seem inevitable?

The slides below are written in the spirit of [Cunningham's Law][cunninghams_law]:
"The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question
it's to post the wrong answer."
I would be grateful for feedback
(either by [email][config_email] or as issues or pull request on [GitHub][config_repo])
on whether you think this approach might work
and if so,
how to do it better.
