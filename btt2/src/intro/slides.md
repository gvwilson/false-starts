## Goals

-   Programming is often portrayed as a solitary activity
-   But real applications are always the work of many people
-   Aim of this course is therefore to show you how to build software in a team
-   And to help you become a *compassionate programmer*
    -   One who cares about the wellbeing of their colleagues,
        their users,
        and society as a whole.
-   What you do to help others helps your future self
-   More importantly,
    now that we know how much harm software can do,
    we need to build it better

## Audience

-   *Yani* is a third year CS student doing her first team project
    -   Help her and her teammates figure out who should do what, when
-   *Sharla* teaches Yani's software engineering class
    -   Help them restructure that course to be more satisfying

## We Know More Than You Realize

-   Empirical studies of programs, programmers, and programming date back more than fifty years
-   Findings are rarely discussed in undergraduate classes
    -   So most books on programming are a mix of personal experience and received wisdom
    -   Which is usually just someone else's personal experience repackaged as a universal truth
-   We cite research where we can

## Why Does Everything Take So Long?

-   Software projects have nine types of waste [%b Sedano2017 %]

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>building the wrong thing</td>
      <td>mismanaging the backlog</td>
      <td>rework</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>unnecessarily complex solutions</td>
      <td>extraneous cognitive load</td>
      <td>psychological distress</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>waiting and multitasking</td>
      <td>knowledge loss</td>
      <td>ineffective communication</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

-   None of these are software issues
-   If you only think about code and not about who writes it and how,
    everything will take longer and hurt more than it needs to

## Programming as a Human Activity

> Nothing in software engineering makes sense except in the light of psychology.
>
> â€” [Theodosius Dobzhansky][dobzhanskys_law] (modified)

-   Our mental capability is limited [%b Hermans2021 %]
-   Our designs and development processes have to take these limits into account

## Sociotechnical Congruence

-   The software we build is shaped by the organizations that build it
    and shapes them in turn [%b Cataldo2008 %]
    -   How you run meetings determines whose opinions are heard,
        which in turn determines the architecture that emerges from those meetings
    -   How programmers are evaluated
        determines whether they thrive in their jobs or not [%b Hicks2023 %]
    -   The tools that allow people to build communities online
        are used to amplify hate for profit
-   We cannot understand programs and programming
    unless we understand organizations as well as individuals
