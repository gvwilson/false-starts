syllabus:
-   "Measuring programmers' productivity is hard and depends on context."
-   Developers are most productive when they're thriving, which depends on four factors.
-   "**Agency**: have a voice in how they're measured and can disagree with team definitions of success."
-   "**Motivation and self-efficacy**: motivated by problems, can see tangible progress, doing the work they want to do, and confident they can solve problems even when they're hard."
-   "**Learning culture**: learning new skills and able to share what they're learning."
-   "**Support and belonging**: accepted for who they are and able to grow, learn, and make mistakes."
-   Being graded while juggling several courses works against all of these, but society isn't willing to invest enough resources to support other forms of feedback.
-   Much easier to grade artefacts than processes, but ignoring the latter devalues **invisible work**.
-   Organizations prefer everyone to do things the same way, even if it's less productive, because it's easier to manage.
-   No one has invented a meaningful measure of code quality.
-   Peer evaluation can be gamed, and is subject to conscious and unconscious bias.
-   It's unfair to ask people to assess each other or each other's work if they have not been trained to do so.
