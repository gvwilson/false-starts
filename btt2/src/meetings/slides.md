## Motivation

-   Everyone complains about meetings
-   But musicians don't complain about playing in ensembles
-   Difference is that musicians are taught how to play together
-   A few simple rules will make meetings more productive

---

## None of This is New

## Do We Need to Meet?

-   To collaborate? That's a different kind of gathering…
-   To inform? Only if you are expecting questions
    -   Send a *brief* email
    -   That is archived somewhere
-   To consult? Only if people get a vote
    -   Otherwise it's just informing with pretense
-   *To keep each other up to date and make decisions*
    -   But only in small groups
    -   Or with well-defined procedural rules

---

## Clear Rules for Decisions

-   Every group has a power structure [%b Freeman1972 %]
-   The only question is whether it's explicit and accountable…
-   …or implicit and unaccountable
-   If you need Robert's Rules, you need training

---

## Create an Agenda

-   If you don't care enough to make a list, you don't need a meeting
    -   Include timings
    -   Prioritize
-   Always discuss the most important items first
    -   "Let's just clear a few small things out of the way"
        always results in big decisions being made in the last few minutes
	without adequate discussion
-   Agendas allow you to make an informed decision about *not* joining meetings
    -   But note that if you do so, you are agreeing in advance to their decisions

## Plan to End Early

> The fundamental unit of time is the bladder.

## Moderator's Responsibilities

-   Always choose a moderator
-   Moderators should not do all the talking
    -   Any more than conductors play all the notes
-   Call on specific people in order
-   Allow them one point at a time
-   Keep a backlog

---

## Participants' Responsibilities

-   Read the agenda and material before the meeting
-   Take your own notes
    -   Helps you stay focused
-   Always raise your hand to speak
    -   So that the moderator can call on you
-   Put down your hand if someone makes your point before you
-   Decline invitations
    -   But if you do so, you are agreeing in advance to the meeting's decisions

---

## Take Minutes

-   So people who weren't there know what happened
-   So people who were there agree what happened
-   So people can be held accountable at later meetings
-   Someone other than the moderator should do this

---

## Require Politeness

-   All the other rules are special cases of this…
-   No interruptions
    -   Except by moderator
-   No technology during in-person meeting
    -   Except for assistive technology or family need
    -   "Please put your devices in politeness mode"
-   No rambling

---

<!--# class="aside" -->

## Online Meetings

-   The "no technology" rule is impossible to enforce in online meetings
-   Which is one of the reasons they are less satisfying than in-person meetings

---

## What to Discuss

-   Progress, plans, and problems go up
-   Context and priorities come down
-   Enforce a three-sentence rule
    -   Any topic initially gets three sentences
    -   If it needs more time (or more questions), moderator adds to backlog
    -   Can then prioritize larger points to use available time efficiently

---

## Be an Active Participant

-   Read the agenda and material before the meeting
    -   You can read faster than people can talk
    -   It makes for shorter meetings
-   Take notes before and during the meeting of things you want to say
    -   Helps you stay focused even
-   Always raise your hand to speak so that the moderator can call on you
-   Put down your hand if someone makes your point before you

---

## Life Online

-   Do not record the meeting without willing consent
-   No mixed-mode meetings: all in person or all online
    -   Feels silly if only one person can't be in person
    -   But mixed-mode meetings are always unfair
-   Take minutes in a shared document that everyone can see
    -   Helps focus
    -   Do this for in-person meetings as well
-   Review meeting protocol at the start for newcomers
    -   "Are we chatting in Zoom, Slack, or the doc?"

---

## A Revealing Game

-   Interruption bingo
    -   Put everyone's name on rows and columns of grids
    -   Add ticks every time person A interrupts person B
-   Quickly realize that:
    1.  The same people do most of the interrupting
    2.  They only interrupt people they believe have lower social status
    3.  They don't realize they're doing it (or enjoy getting away with it)

---

## What the Research Says

-   Social status depends on race, gender, affluence, and dozens of other factors
    -   Manifests as an unearned assumption of privilege
    -   E.g., "I can talk whenever I have something to say, and when I do, other people will stop to let me."
-   Many (many) studies focus on meeting participants' gender
    -   Relatively easy to identify
    -   Cross-cultural effect
-   Men interrupt women more often than they interrupt other men [%b Hancock2014 Karpowitz2014 %]
-   Interruptions and questions are more likely to be patronizing or hostile [%b Dupas2021 %]

%]

---

## Leveling the Playing Field

-   People with higher status often don't realize
    they've been playing on "easy mode" their whole live [%b Scalzi2012 %]
    -   Often resent being required to play by the same rules as everyone else
-   Have explicit meeting rules and a moderator to ensure fairness
    -   Produces better outcomes
    -   And *it's the right thing to do*

---

## In Practice

-   Don't tolerate "well actually" corrections
    -   Nitpicking's real purpose is almost always to demonstrate social dominance
-   Don't raise points you don't actually believe in
    -   The devil doesn't need more advocates
-   Equally, don't make excuses for your questions or opinions
    -   "This is probably stupid, but…" is usually a sign that you have internalized others' belief that you are inferior
-   Managing this is the moderator's most important responsibility

---

## Three Stickies

-   Everyone gets three sticky notes at the start of the meeting
    -   Or jelly beans, or coins, or…
-   Each time someone speaks, take away one token
-   When someone is out of tokens, they are not allowed to speak
    until everyone has used at least one
    -   At which point everyone gets back all their tokens
-   Ensures that no one speaks more than three times as often as the quietest person in the meeting
-   Effects:
    -   Ensures space for people who have gotten so used to being trampled
        that they've given up trying to get a word in
    -   Helps the people doing the trampling realize it

## Who Are You?

1.  Read [NOAA Guide to Dealing with Disruptive Behaviors][noaa_disruptive].
2.  Which one do you think best describes you?
3.  Which one do your teammates think best describes you?
4.  What action are you going to take in your next meeting to correct for this?
