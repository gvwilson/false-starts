title: Starting
---

-   Create a repository on GitHub called `nitinat`
    -   Did this under a personal account, but for a real project would do it under an organizational account
-    Chose a name that wasn't already taken on [PyPI][pypi]
    -   Because we want to create a package in future
    -   All the good names are taken, so I chose the name of a small town near where I grew up
-   Made it public
-   Added the following:
    -   `README.md` (this file) is normally a description of the project, but we'll use it for note-taking
    -   `.gitignore` (selected from pulldown) to tell Git not to track ephemeral files generated by Python projects
    -   [MIT license][mit_license] (which GitHub puts in `LICENSE` rather than `LICENSE.md` - rename it)
-   Rename `LICENSE` to `LICENSE.md` (because file extensions are good)
-   Add `*~` to the `.gitignore` (for Emacs users)
-   Add a Code of conduct
    -   Used to copy in a Markdown file, but [GitHub now supports this directly][gh_coc]
-   Follow GitHub's instructions to add CoC
    -   Call the branch `feat/code-of-conduct` (colons don't play nicely in Git branch names)
-   Copy in `CONTRIBUTING.md` from an existing project and edit
    -   Rename/add tags in GitHub to match descriptions in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
        (because GitHub's defaults aren't sensible)
-   Don't add a `GOVERNANCE.md` file explaining how decisions are made and who gets to make them
    -   But will as soon as the project attracts other people
-   Note: if you and your team are creating a lot of projects,
    consider using [Cookiecutter][cookiecutter] to keep them consistent
-   Write these notes in `src/starting/index.md`
    -   We'll see how to turn these into a website in [% x website %]
    -   Use `[text][key]` links in the body of my Markdown files and `[key]: url` in the foot
-   Commit changes with a message that follows [conventional commits][conventional_commits]:

```
feat: describing steps so far and cleaning up default files

-   Add `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`
-   Rename `LICENSE` to show it's a Markdown file
-   Add notes to `README.md` about steps so far
-   Add Emacs backup files to `.gitignore
```

-   The subject line describes what kind of change it is (adding a feature)
-   The body itemizes the changes
    -   Include full paragraphs and code samples if appropriate
-   Push to GitHub
