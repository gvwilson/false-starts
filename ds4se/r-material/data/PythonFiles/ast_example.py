'''
This is a program that calls upon Python's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). I have used a bash script to call this program on a directory of Python programs, which writes the number of lines and number of functions to a Stats/python_stats.csv file. Currently, it touches the file twice, which is a shame. First, to count the number of functions, next to count the number of lines. I couldn't get them to read simultaneously.

Python Files: https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python.git

Bash script:
Inside the directory with all your python files, run this. It will write to "Stats/python_stats.csv"

 for f in Programs/*.py; do python3 ast_example.py "$f"; done

 To clear the Stats/python_stats.csv file, run:
 cat /dev/null > Stats/python_stats.csv
