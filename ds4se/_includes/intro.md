Programmers frequently make claims about software development practices,
the relative merits of different languages,
and the causes of bias in the tech sector,
but most programmers are never taught how to find, analyze, and interpret actual evidence on those topics.
We have therefore created an introduction to data science for software engineers
that uses software engineering questions and data
to motivate common statistical tools and methods.
