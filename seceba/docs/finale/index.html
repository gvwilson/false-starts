<h1>Conclusion</h1>


        <p>Three books changed my life as a programmer.
[<a href="../bib/#Kernighan1981">Kernighan1981</a>] taught me I could do more than just write software—I could <em>design</em> it—while
[<a href="../bib/#Glass2002">Glass2002</a>] taught me we could study software and software development scientifically
to determine what actually works (or doesn't).
In between those two books I read [<a href="../bib/#Hunt1999">Hunt1999</a>]:
for many programmers of my generation,
it was the first time someone had described the craft of software construction
in a way that made sense.</p>
<p>I referred to those books over and over again
when I started teaching at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto</a> in the early 2000s,
but re-reading them now,
I'm struck by what they <em>don't</em> discuss.
How do you run a meeting in a way that ensures everyone is heard?
After forty years in tech,
I believe that is the most important skill I ever learned.
How and why does tech marginalize women,
people of color,
and members of the LGBT community?
And given how aggressively software is amplifying hate for profit in ways that threaten us all,
shouldn't every guide to being a better programmer at least mention the problem?</p>
<p>The books I turned to when I was a young(er) programmer don't even ask these questions;
neither do newer ones like [<a href="../bib/#Larson2019">Larson2019</a>, <a href="../bib/#Thomas2019">Thomas2019</a>].
This one can't answer them all,
but I hope you've enjoyed a little practical idealism,
and I hope you'll use it to build a better world.</p>
