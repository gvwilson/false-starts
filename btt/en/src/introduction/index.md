## Audience {: #introduction-audience}

These [personas][t3_personas] describe who this book is for [%b Wilson2019 %]:

## Topics {: #introduction-contents}

[%x glossary %] defines the terms these lessons introduce,
which in turn define this book's big ideas:

-   FIXME

## Layout {: #introduction-layout}

We display source code like this:

[% inc file="python_sample.py" %]

and Unix shell commands like this:
{: .continue}

[% inc file="shell_sample.sh" %]

Data files and program output are shown in italics:
{: .continue}

[% inc file="output_sample.out" %]

[% inc file="data_sample.yml" %]

We use `...` to show where lines have been omitted,
and occasionally wrap lines in unnatural ways to make them fit on the page.
Where we need to break lines for the same reason,
we end all but the last line with a single backslash `\`.
The full listings are all available in [our Git repository][btt_repo]
and [on our website][btt_site].

Finally,
we write functions as `function_name` rather than `function_name()`.
The latter is more common,
but people don't use `array_name[]` for arrays,
and the empty parentheses makes it hard to tell
whether we're talking about "the function itself" or "a call to the function with no parameters".
