# Software Design in Python: A Tool-Based Introduction

The best way to learn design is to study examples,
and some of the best examples of software design come from

These lessons build small versions of file backup systems,
testing frameworks,
and regular expression matchers
both to demystify them
and to give some insights into how experienced programmers think.
